# 👋 Hi, I’m Facu Gonzalez  
### TL Backend @ Loyalty  

I'm a software engineer with a decade of experience and a passion for building reliable, high-performance applications from the ground up. Recently, I've been diving deeper into **systems programming**, **concurrency**, and **distributed systems**, which challenge me to balance theory with real-world applications.

As a fan of automation and cloud-native technologies, I enjoy leveraging tools like **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab Runners**, and **Jenkins** to streamline CI/CD pipelines. My work often involves refining container orchestration with **Docker** and **Kubernetes** to boost scalability and resilience. I thrive on the challenge of making complex systems work in harmony through strategic refactoring and architectural foresight.
